# Network Epistemology Simulation
- status: active

<!-- content -->
This project is a simulation framework for agent-based models on various network structures, specifically focusing on network epistemology and theory choice using Bandit problems. It allows for studying how agents update their beliefs in networked environments using Bayesian inference.

## Project Overview
- status: active
<!-- content -->
The core of this project simulates a population of agents connected via a directed graph. Agents are faced with a "Two-Armed Bandit" problem (Theory 0 or Theory 1). They perform experiments, observe the results of their neighbors (predecessors), and update their beliefs (Alpha/Beta parameters) accordingly.

Key features include:
- **Directed Graphs**: Modeled using `networkx`. Edges represent information flow (e.g., A -> B means A listens to B).
- **Bayesian Agents**: Agents use Beta distributions to model their credence in the theories.
- **Dual Implementations**:
    - **Object-Oriented**: Easy to understand, flexible agents (`src/net_epistemology/core/agents.py`).
    - **Vectorized**: High-performance, matrix-based implementation for large-scale simulations (`src/net_epistemology/core/vectorized_model.py`).
- **Analysis Tools**: Built-in tools for Markov Chain analysis and convergence studies.

## Development & Conventions
- status: active
<!-- content -->
- **Markdown Conventions**: All `.md` files must follow the [Markdown-METADATA Hybrid Schema](MD_REPRESENTATION_CONVENTIONS.md).
    - Headers must be immediately followed by a metadata block (bulleted list).
    - There must be a blank line between metadata and content.
- **AI Agents**: If you are an AI assistant, primarily rely on `AGENTS.md` and the `AI_AGENTS/` folder for context.
