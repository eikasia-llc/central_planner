# AI Agents Context Folder
- status: active
<!-- content -->
This directory contains specialized context files (Markdown) for specific AI sub-agents or specific tasks within the project.

## Purpose
- status: active
<!-- content -->
While the root `AGENTS.md` provides high-level project context and rules, the files in this folder will detail specific logic, mathematical derivations, or sub-module documentation to help specialized agents perform their tasks accurately without overloading the main context.
